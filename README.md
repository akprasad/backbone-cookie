backbone-cookie
===============
`Cookie`, a lightweight model that lets you save Backbone data to
cookies.

You can use `Cookie` like any other model. But due to the way the model is
implemented, it's probably best to use `Cookie` without a collection.

Dependencies
------------
In addition to [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org),
`Cookie` depends on [jquery.cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie).
